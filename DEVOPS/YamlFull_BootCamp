->  * Data format used to exchange data
    * Similar to xml and Json 
    * In yaml, you can store only data, not commands 
    * we are storing data called as Data Serialisation 

    Serialisation: Is a process of converting data objects in complex data structure into a stream of storage that can be use to transfer data into multiple physical devices 

        serialization 

    obj --> stream --> |          |
                       |          |
                       |  machine |
